"""position_monitor — exit management for the bot's own positions.

Every cycle runs ``core.positions.manage_open_positions`` over the
broker's open positions:
  * breakeven / trailing stop tightening (risk can only go down);
  * time-based closes past max_hold_hours;
  * on every close, core.positions emits ``position.closed`` and calls
    our on_close hook so the signal ledger is updated.

Only positions with ``is_own`` are touched — anything the bot did not
open is left alone. Close/modify power for operator-initiated closes
stays behind the execution gateway (forex.close_position); this daemon
runs the *standing* exit policy, which is the one surface the original
system already automated and which the risk audit classifies as local
safety (defense in depth), not discretionary trading.
