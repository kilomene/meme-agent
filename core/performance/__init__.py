"""
Performance review + cost tracking — ported from the original bridge's
performance_review.py and cost_tracking.py, now behind BrokerAdapter
(no direct broker SDK).

Self-performance review uses the broker's own deal history as ground
truth — not a status approximation. Deal history returns every actual
closed deal on the account, including real profit/loss, which is the
only honest source for "how has this bot actually performed."

Filters to deals with the bot's magic number so trades placed manually
or by something else on the same account are never mixed in.
