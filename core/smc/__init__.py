"""
Chart structure analysis: turns a list of candles into the structured
information a discretionary SMC (Smart Money Concepts) trader would read
off a chart by eye. Every function here is a real, deterministic algorithm
against a stated definition — SMC terminology varies somewhat between
traders, so the exact definition used is documented on each function
rather than assumed to be "the" definition.

Operates on any candle-like object with .time/.open/.high/.low/.close
attributes (duck-typed deliberately, so this module has zero dependency
on any broker SDK and is fully testable on any platform — see
test_smc_analysis.py, which runs without a broker runtime).

Session info is deliberately NOT duplicated here — that's already served
by the Worker's get_session_info tool (src/agent/knowledge.js), no need
for two implementations of the same UTC-clock lookup.
