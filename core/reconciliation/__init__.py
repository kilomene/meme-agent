"""
Reconciliation — ported from the original bridge's reconciliation.py,
now behind BrokerAdapter (no direct broker SDK).

Closes a real gap: the cloud/sync layer only learns a position closed
when the bot itself triggers the close (positions exit manager:
trailing stop / breakeven / time exit). A position closed manually at
the broker — directly, outside the bot — would otherwise never reach
the sync layer, silently degrading correlation-exposure checks,
reflection generation, and the picture of what's still open.

This runs periodically, comparing the broker's real open positions
(ground truth) against every signal the bot believes is still open
(supplied by the caller, e.g. read from the store journal by the
daemon). Anything believed open but actually closed gets reconciled by
looking up the real closing deal and reporting it through the same
`on_close(signal_id, reason, price, costs)` callback the exit manager
uses — which means downstream reflection now fires for EVERY close,
not just the ones the bot triggered itself.
