"""
Event shim — the local end of the event system (TARGET §4).

emit(event: dict) validates the event, then tries to forward it to the
real bus at agent.events.bus.publish (owned by the interface-builder);
when that import fails (bus not installed yet, standalone checkout), the
event is appended to a module-level in-process queue that the bus owner
drains later via drain_queue(). The build master rewires this to the
real bus when it lands.

Schema (TARGET §4): every event carries at least:
    {"event": "<dotted.name>", "ts": "<iso8601>", ...}
Known names: signal.detected, trade.requested, trade.executed,
trade.rejected, risk.blocked, broker.disconnected, kill_switch.activated,
kill_switch.deactivated, position.closed, health.check. Other dotted
names are accepted (the bus owner may add more) but must match
^[a-z0-9_]+(\\.[a-z0-9_]+)+$.
