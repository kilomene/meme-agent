"""
Position exit management — ported from the original bridge's
exit_manager.py, now behind BrokerAdapter (no direct broker SDK).

SAFETY PRINCIPLE (enforced in code, not just documented): every action
here can only move a position toward LESS risk — tightening a stop,
locking in profit, or closing a trade that's overstayed. It never widens
a stop, never adds to a position, and never opens new exposure.

Three mechanisms, in order of precedence:
  1. Time-based exit — close a position open longer than
     `max_hold_hours` without hitting TP. Prevents "hope and hold."
  2. Trailing stop — once profit >= `trailing_activation_atr` * ATR,
     trail SL `trailing_atr_multiplier` * ATR behind price. Only moves
     the stop in the favorable direction (tightens), never loosens.
  3. Breakeven stop — once profit >= `breakeven_trigger_atr` * ATR,
     move SL to entry. Trade can no longer lose money.

Close reporting goes to an `on_close(signal_id, reason, close_price,
costs)` callback supplied by the caller (the daemon wires it to the
cloud sync / journal); every close also emits a `position.closed`
event. Only positions with the bot's magic number are touched.
